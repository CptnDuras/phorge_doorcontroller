# Phorge Doore Access control system
This is a PoC Door access control system

It utilizes a serial monitor script to talk to an arduino controller that will then check the database for a card, then check to see if the card is allowed access

The second part is a Django project that provides a GUI to see card logs, and give access to users and cards.
